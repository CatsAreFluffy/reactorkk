# reactorkk
A knockoff of a knockoff of a knockoff (jk) of a small component of a Minecraft mod. Play at https://catsarefluffy.github.io/reactorkk/

For dowload play: Don't forget to uncompress the downloaded zip! Otherwise, the game will most likely crash when you place a component.

Made by me (CatsAreFluffy) and [Makeworld](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MAKEWORLD/)
